      <h2 id="mission-heart">The Heart Behind Our Mission</h2>

      <p>Every mission starts with a story, and mine began with Mittens. She was the sweetest, most gentle kitten who finally had a chance at life after my sister rescued her and her siblings. She received her vaccinations and heartworm prevention, but one thing slipped through the cracks: parasites. I was undereducated and didn’t know to check for them, and just a week later, she was gone. Losing her was one of the hardest things I have ever endured, and it opened my eyes to how much I did not know.</p>

      <p>That experience changed everything. It made me realize how many pet owners and rescues face the same challenges, not out of neglect but out of not knowing what to look for. I cannot change what happened to Mittens, but I can do everything in my power to make sure others do not go through the same pain.</p>

      <p>This mission website was created to share that knowledge, to help new pet owners keep their pets happy and healthy, and to give rescue animals more chances to find the homes they deserve.</p>

      <p>And the shirts? They are more than just apparel. They are how the mission spreads.</p>

      <p>At the end of the day, this is about impact. It is about helping as many pets, pet parents, and rescues alike. Because every animal deserves a chance, and every person deserves the tools to give them one.</p>
